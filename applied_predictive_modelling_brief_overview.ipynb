    "1) First one uses the tree-based model can specifically account for the missing data. *(I have never seen this approach being used in real life but that is just my experience)*  \n",
    "2) The second one is to impute the missing values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If the number of predictors with missing values are small, then EDA is the best option. If a variable with a high missing value is highly correlated with another variable that has few missing values then\n",
    "a model can be created to impute those missing values  \n",
    "\n",
    "One popular technique is the **K-nearest neighbour model**. The advantage is that the imputed values are confined to be within the range of the training set values. The disadvantage is that the entire training set has to be used to impute on missing value variable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another technique used is **linear regression** between the predictor which is highly correlated and one with missing values. *(I am not sure why the author mentions using linear regression with predictor which is highly correlated and one with missing values since highly correlated predictors are removed anyways)\n",

    "### Overfitting and its Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overfitting** *refers to a model that models the training data too well.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Overfitting happens when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. This means that the noise or random fluctuations in the training data is picked up and learned as concepts by the model. The problem is that these concepts do not apply to new data and negatively impact the models ability to generalize.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Overfitting is* **more likely with nonparametric and nonlinear models** *that have more flexibility when learning a target function. As such, many nonparametric machine learning algorithms also include parameters or techniques to limit and constrain how much detail the model learns.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We must use the existing data to identify settings for the models parameters that yield the best and most realistic predictive performance (known as **model tuning**)\n",
    "\n",
    "This has been achieved by splitting the existing data into **training and test sets**\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to learning the general patterns in the data, the model has also learned the characteristics of each samples unique noise. This type of model is said to be overfit and will usually have a poor accuracy when predicting a new sample. *An example is provided below*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Many models have tuning parameters which cannot be directly estimated from the data. Since many of these parameters control the complexity of the model, poor choices for the values can result in overfitting   \n",
    "\n",
    "For example lets discuss on the **cost parameter**. When the cost is large, the model will go to great lengths to correctly label every point while smaller values will produce a model that are not as aggressive\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Splitting usually entails a training, validation and test set**\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"training\" data is the general term for the samples used to create the model while the test or validation data is set used to qualify performance  \n",
    "\n",
    "When number of samples are not large, a strong case can be made that a test set should be avoided because every sample may be needed for modelling  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is always a desire to make the test and training set as homogeneous as possible  \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to split the data into a training and test set is to take a random sample  \n",
    "\n",
    "When one class has a disproportionally small frequency compared to the others, there is a chance that the distribution of the outcomes may be substantially different between the training and test sets. To account for the outcome **stratified random sampling** applies random sampling within subgroups. The data can also be split on the basis of the predictor values based on **maximum dissimilarity sampling**\n",

    "\n",
    "#### K-Fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "The samples are randomly partitioned into k sets of roughly equal size. A model is fit using the all samples except the first subset (called the first fold). The held-out samples are predicted by this model and used to estimate performance measures. The first subset is returned to the training set and procedure repeats with the second subset hold out and so on. The k sampling estimates of performance are summarized and used to understand the relationship between the tuning parameter and model utility.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A slight variant is to select the k partitions in a way that makes the folds balanced with respect to the outcome (Stratified random sampling) \n",
    "\n",
    "Another version, **leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV)** is the special case where k is the number of samples\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of k is between 5 and 10 but there is no formal rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Fold generally has a larger variance as compared to other medhots and for that reason might not be attractive. However, with large training sets the potential issues with variance and bias become negligible. Larger values of k are also more computationally burdensome.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Following shows a visual explaination of k-fold*\n",

    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "cvSplits <- createFolds(trainclasses, k = 10, returnTrain = TRUE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Repeated Training Test Splits\n",
    "Also knows as the **\"leave-group-out cross validation\"**, the technique simply creates multiple splits of the data into modelling and prediction sets. The number of repetitions is important. Increasing the number of subsets has the effect of decreasing the uncertianity of the performance estimates. To get stable estimates of performance, it is suggested to choose a large number of repetitions (say 50-200)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "\n",
    "repeatedSplits <- createDataPartition(trainclasses, p =0.8, times = 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### The Bootstrap\n",
    "A bootstrap sample is a random sample of the data taken with replacement. This means that after a data point is selected for the subset, it is still available for further selection. In general, bootstrap methods have less uncertainity than k-fold cross-validation\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Data Splitting Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1) If the sample size is small, we recommend repeated 10-fold cross-validation for several reasion: The bias and variance properties are good and given the sample size the computational costs are not large  \n",
    "\n",
    "2) If the goal is to choose between models as opposed to getting the best indicator of performance, a strong case can be made for using one of the bootstrap procedures since these have very low variance  \n",
    "\n",
    "3) For large sample sizes, the differences between resampling methods become less pronounced and computational efficiency increases in importance. Here simple 10-fold cross-validation should provide acceptable variance, low bias and is relatively quick to compare\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing Between Models\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Start with several models that are the least interpretable and most flexible  \n",
    "2) Investigate the simple models that are less opaque (are not complete black boxes)  \n",
    "3) Consider using the simplest model that reasonably approximates the performance of the more complex model  \n",

This means that samples that are difficult to classify receive increasingly larger weights until the algorithm identifies a model that correctly classifies these samples. Therefore, each iteration of the algorithm is required to learn a different aspect of the data, focusing on regions that contain difficult-to-classify samples. At each iteration, a stage weight is computed based on the error rate at that iteration. The nature of the stage weight described in Algorithm 14.2 implies that more accurate models have higher positive values and less accurate\n",
    "models have lower negative values.5 The overall sequence of weighted classifiers is then combined into an ensemble and has a strong potential to classify better than any of the individual classifiers.\n",
